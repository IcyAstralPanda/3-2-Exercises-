# 3-2-Exercises-
**In this Project we learned how to make formulas but modified them to make them shorter, and we learned that using "Double" can make a difference on how the code if affected.**

**And how decimals can also affect the code in a certain way.
making the output different by making it a decimal number instead of a whole number.** 

**We also learned about "addition assignment" basically using "+=" to reduce the code needed making it cleaner.**
